# Movies-ETL

**Overview**
The project is to EXTRACT, TRANSFORM, and LOAD movie data from wikipedia, Kaggle, and ratings to generate a clean dataset for a movie database to be used for a hackathon.

In this project, **ETL** was used to extract the Wikipedia and Kaggle data from their files and the dataset was transformed/cleaned by checking rows and formatting datatypes. We also performed joins and loaded the transformed dataset into a SQL database.

**Overview**
The purpose of this analysis is to extract data, perform function testing, transform, and clean data and at the end of the **ETL** process, the data was loaded to the database in the ETL_create_database.ipynb jupyter notebook

The movies table has 6,052 rows and the ratings table has 26,024,289 rows, as shown below in the screenshot of each query and the output.
